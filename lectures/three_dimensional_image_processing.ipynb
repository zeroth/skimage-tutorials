We can construct a 3D volume as a series of 2D `planes`, giving 3D images the shape `(plane, row, column)`. Multichannel data adds a `channel` dimension in the final position containing color information. \n",

Most experimental data captures one dimension at a lower resolution than the other two; e.g., photographing thin slices to approximate a 3D structure as a stack of 2D images. The distance between pixels in each dimension, called `spacing`, is encoded in a tuple and is accepted as a parameter by some `skimage` functions and can be used to adjust contributions to filters.\n",
